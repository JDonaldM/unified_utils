Welcome to unified_utils's documentation!
=========================================

The funstions and scripts of ``unified_utils`` form a pipeline for carrying out 
cosmological parameter inference with the unified multipole measurements published 
in Beutler and McDonald 
(`2021 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2021/11/031>`_).

This is the inference pipeline used in Donald-McCann et al. 
(`2023 <https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/526/3/3461/7285827>`_).
